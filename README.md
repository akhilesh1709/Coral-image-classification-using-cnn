# Coral Image classification using CNN

This repository is an example of using CNN to classify whether the given coral image is healthy or bleached..

### Implementation Details
- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is preprocessed to handle any missing values, perform feature scaling, and encode categorical variables as needed.
- **Train-Test Split:** The dataset is split into a training set and a test set.
- **CNN Model Training:** The model is trained by adding dense layers, maxpooling and flattening layers.
- **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated on the test data to assess its performance in prediction.

### Requirements
  - Python 3.x   

### Libraries:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn (sklearn)
  - tensorflow

### How to Use the Repository
